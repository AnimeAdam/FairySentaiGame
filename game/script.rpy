# Scene 1: Yuviiin speech
# Yuviiin bal Favijra steps up to the podium, with both hands raised.
# Yuviiin bal Favijra
# Fairykind one and all.
# Yuviiin raises one fist in the air.
# YUVIIIN BAL FAVIJRA
# We were scattered across here, there and everywhere.
# Under the strugglehold of tyrants and degenerates.
# Not to serve for the greater good, but to suck at the Juuvket's tet and hide like cowards in their shadow.
# Yuviiin puts his hands out stretched.
# YUVIIIN BAL FAVIJRA
# And as your loyal Uvvjual, I have chained those madmen.
# I have brought them to the new order.
# I have brought all of Fairkind together under one banner.
# One truth of this world.
# Close up: Yuviiin face
# YUVIIIN BAL FAVIJRA
# UNITY.
# Only together can we fight our real enemy.
# Yuviiin slams his fist down.
# YUVIIIN BAL FAVIJRA
# THE HUMAN!
# WHILE WE WERE SUFFERING AND BRINGING THE WORLD TO ORDER.
# THESE HUMANS WERE POISONING OUR WATER, BURNING OUR FORESTS AND PLUNDERING OUR LAND.
# Yuviiin steps back with both hands on the podium.
# YUVIIIN BAL FAVIJRA
# As such with the world united and Fairykind prospering.
# I have taken the initiative to exterminating their foul race once and for all.
# So I ask you who is your Uvvjual and what are we going to do?
# Wide shot: shows a group of soldiers raising their swords in the air.
# Army
# AOU AOU AOU!
# YUVIIIN BAL FAVIJRA
# AND SO... THE CLEANSING BEGINS!
# Yuviiin walked off the stage towards his companion and most loyal advisor Rayjk vu Beoplae, and then entered a coach for the palace.
# Rayjk rubs his hands together while talking.
# Rayjk vu beoplae
# What is the next plan.
# YUVIIIN BAL FAVIJRA
# There is no next plan.
# RAYJK VU BEOPLAE
# So we exterminate the humans and then we have achieved world peace.
# YUVIIIN BAL FAVIJRA
# Yes, for a simple as it may seem, once the humans are no longer an issue we can proceed restoring the world.
# RAYJK VU BEOPLAE
# There is an old saying:
# "A man toils the field when he is hungry."
# "A mad man toils the field until all he can be is hungry."
# YUVIIIN BAL FAVIJRA
# We must do something.
# I have lost so much to become the Uvvjual.
# This will be the greatest push for Fairykind to reaching eternal peace.
# RAYJK VU BEOPLAE
# At the cost of distrupting the natural order.
# YUVIIIN BAL FAVIJRA
# There is no natural order for humans.
# They are like a illness, they enter and then exit once there is no more blood to spill.
# RAYJK VU BEOPLAE
# Let us hope that you are right, I thought you mad once.
# But you have shown that madness is the only way to bring the ultimate good.
# YUVIIIN BAL FAVIJRA
# I am happy you trust me so, I only wish that I had acted sooner.
